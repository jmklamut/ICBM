The ICBM is an interactive chessboard that seeks to provide chess players with a way to play against an chess engine opponent on a physical board. With chess's historied origins coming from 
physical boards, and modern chess being centered increasingly more around digital/online chess, this chessboard seeks to bridge that gap. Using this board, a player can play against 
another human or an chess engine opponent of variable difficulty. The board includes certain amenities such as a built-in clock, a mechanical arm for the chess engine to interact with the clock, and an 
array of LED inside the board. The main purpose of the LEDs is to light up certain squares on the board to visually display the chess engine opponent's move. The human player will then move 
the AI's pieces according to the squares lit up. Finally, the board contains a small LCD screen which functions as a UI for communicating with the AI.
